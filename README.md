# Yuxin_HCI_VA

The project contains two parts:
1. The Virtual Agent was built through Mixamo & Fuse and then developed further in Unity.(the unity package was too large to upload here so was submitted through Canvas Final Project submission page.)
2. The android video analyzing app is based on Affectiva SDK sample code.  Go to https://developer.affectiva.com/ to get access to Affectiva SDKs in various platforms.
I added functionalities so that it will map expressions data with expression names while write to a csv file in its external storage. It also labels negative expressions in negative number and positive expressions in posistive number. When a video is chosen, it will extract facial expressions data and have it displayed on screen while write it to a csv file.
