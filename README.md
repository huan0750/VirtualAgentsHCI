The android video analyzing app is based on Affectiva SDK sample code. I added functionalities so that it will map expressions data with expression names while write to a csv file in its external storage. It also labels negative expressions in negative number and positive expressions in posistive number. When a video is chosen, it will extract facial expressions data and have it displayed on screen while write it to a csv file.
